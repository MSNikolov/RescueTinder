# RescueTinder

This is the first project I created in asp.net core. The concept is: you can either post a dog that you have for adoption or search for your new pet. Once you have entered your criteria you will be presented with a list of dogs that are still not adopted. Then you pick ones you would have and click the "Like" button ot their page. If you have liked a dog its owner will be able to start a conversation with about the dog and eventually give it to you. 
There are also vets in the app - they can update the dog's health status and write notes. A user is able to obtain status of a vet if he can prove his qualification to the admin. Each owner can select his dog's vet from a list.
